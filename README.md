# Asteroid Game

## Game Dynamics

The Asteroid game is a classic arcade-style game where the player controls a spaceship navigating through a field of asteroids. The primary objectives are to avoid collisions with the asteroids and to destroy them using the spaceship's laser weapon. Each asteroid splits into smaller ones when hit, and the game continues until the player loses all lives.

### Core Features:
- **Player Control**: The player controls a spaceship that can move and shoot in a 2D space.
- **Asteroids**: Randomly spawned asteroids drift through space. They can be destroyed by the player's shots, causing them to split into smaller pieces.
- **Gameplay Mechanics**: The spaceship and asteroids move according to simple physics, taking into account velocity and direction.

## Possible Expansions

To enhance the game experience further, consider implementing the following features:

1. **Add a Scoring System**: Introduce points for each destroyed asteroid, and display the score on the game screen.

2. **Implement Multiple Lives and Respawning**: Allow the player to have multiple lives. Upon collision with an asteroid, respawn the player after a brief delay.

3. **Add an Explosion Effect for Asteroids**: Create visual and sound effects for when asteroids are destroyed.

4. **Add Acceleration to Player Movement**: Enhance the control of the spaceship by adding acceleration and deceleration, making the movement more realistic.

5. **Make Objects Wrap Around the Screen**: Instead of disappearing, make asteroids and the spaceship reappear on the opposite side of the screen when they move out of bounds.

6. **Add a Background Image**: Incorporate a space-themed background image to enhance visual appeal.

7. **Create Different Weapon Types**: Include various types of weapons (e.g., rapid fire, spread shot) that the player can use.

8. **Make the Asteroids Lumpy Instead of Perfectly Round**: Add more realistic shapes to the asteroids for a varied appearance.

9. **Make the Ship Have a Triangular Hit Box Instead of a Circular One**: Change the collision detection of the spaceship to be more precise by using a triangular hitbox.

10. **Add a Shield Power-up**: Implement a power-up that provides the player with temporary invincibility.

11. **Add a Speed Power-up**: Allow the player to collect power-ups that temporarily increase the spaceship's speed.

12. **Add Bombs That Can Be Dropped**: Introduce a feature where the player can drop bombs that destroy multiple asteroids in an area.
